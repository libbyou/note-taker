  ## Description

  Note Taker is an application that can be used to write and save notes in order to organize your thoughts and keep track of all the tasks that you need to complete. All the notes you've entered will be kept safe in the database and will be kept on the side so that you will be able to reference your notes whenever you like until you delete them.

  GIVEN a note-taking application

  THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
  WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
  THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
