  ## Description

  Note Taker is an application that can be used to write and save notes in order to organize your thoughts and keep track of all the tasks that you need to complete. All the notes you've entered will be kept safe in the database and will be kept on the side so that you will be able to reference your notes whenever you like until you delete them.

  AS A small business owner
  I WANT to be able to write and save notes
  SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

  GIVEN a note-taking application
  WHEN I open the Note Taker
  THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
  WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
  THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
  WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
  THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
  WHEN I click on the Save button
  THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
  WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
  THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
  WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page
  THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears

  ## Usage

  On the application's homepage, click the 'Get Started' button, which will take you to the notes page. Once on the notes page, you will see on the left-hand side a list of your previous notes. You can click on each of those existing notes to pull them up for you to read again. Or, on the right-hand side, you can enter a new note. You may also do this when looking at an existing note, by clicking the + button on the top right. After you've entered a title and some text for you new note, a save icon will appear on the top right. Click it to save your new note. Your new note will be saved at the end of your existing notes. To delete any notes, click the red delete button on the side of each existing note.
